# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample application

This is the sample application for
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*](http://railstutorial.org)
by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com).

I am using [RubyMine](http://www.jetbrains.com/ruby/)
instead of [Sublime Text 2](http://www.sublimetext.com/2)
as my editor/IDE. Check out tips on using RubyMine in this project's
[wiki](https://github.com/perfectionist/sample_project/wiki)
